## Agile Software Development

# What is Agile?

* **A Methodology**

Agile is a way of exuciting software developement project management, so it is a project methodology.

* **Iterative**

During the project process, we can go back, and make changes if we want. This feature is opposite of [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model).

* **Streamlined**

We don't have huge numbers of documentations, long meetings etc. In Agile, we have lots of quick meetings and short documentations. Our purpose is moving fast in Agile.

* **Time-Boxed**

In Agile, time is important than features. For example, we say that we're gonna develop our project for 3 weeks, and we will try to finish our tasks. It is opposite of saying that we have tasks A,B and we are going to try these tasks to finish in 3 weeks.

* **Very Collaborative**

In Agile projects, everybody talks with each other all the time. It is for moving fast. 

It seems a very useful and easy method but in reality it is hard to apply.

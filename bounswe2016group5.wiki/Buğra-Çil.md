I am Mustafa Buğra Çil. I born in İzmit/Kocaeli in 1993. Studied highschool at Kocaeli Fen Lisesi and choosed Bogazici University to be a computer engineer. I worked in Girişimcilik Vakfı a while and then I passed to Yandex to work as a Service Support Specialist. I recently resigned though. 

I had too much time working with frameworks like OTRS and Jira in Yandex, we mainly used Perl/Python in our department. I've got skills in Java, C++ and Adobe CS5 set.

Rather than those, I am quite interested in History of Europe (After Renaissance), Cinema (Mainly Irish-Welsh Cinema), Music (Tuareg Jazz Fusion, Garage Revival, Folk/Blues, Jugoslavian Rock Scene, Grunge Rock) and Decoration/Design.

Let's get broaden our horizons together! I would like to share some of my tastes with you.

My favourite period is Napeloeonic Wars in history. I suggest David Chandler's book "The Campaigns of Napoleon".

Two of my favourite films in Irish cinema are "In Bruges" and "The Guard".

I want to share some songs to reflect my favourite genres.

It is a book by consultant and speaker [Patrick Lencioni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lencioni). It's about some issues that teams can face.

According to the book, the **five dysfunctions** are:

* Absence of trust—unwilling to be vulnerable within the group
* Fear of conflict—seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate
* Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization
* Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards
* Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success

The video we saw, is more about first matter "Absence of trust". According to this video, one member with absence of trust in a group can damage to group. So it is very important that each member of a group must trust to other members.We can explain this further as vulnerability based trust,that supports each individual of the team.As a consequence,each member of the team could easily talk about their mistakes and how to avoid them for later purposes.

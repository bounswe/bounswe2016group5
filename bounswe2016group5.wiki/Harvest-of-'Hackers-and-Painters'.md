I recently finished the _Hackers and Painters_ from **Paul Graham** which should have been read by all entrepreneurs and then be re-read, in my humble opinion. One of the best software engineering books, in every section, made me like "mmm-ah". Within a lot of great suggestions and nicely created definitons, I re-read some parts and brought some stuff about SWE.

"Sometimes what the hackers do is called "software engineering," but this term is just as misleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are. The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply defined, but it's there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do, and engineers figure out how to do it.

What and how should not be kept too separate. You're asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without understanding how to do it. But hacking can certainly be more than just deciding how to implement some spec. At its best, it's creating the spec-- though it turns out the best way to do that is to implement it." - _Paul Graham_

He complains a bit about sofware world clusters, defines himself as a "hacker" and thinks that transitivity between CS, CE and SWE can mislead. By looking down to 2004, I think we succeed to distinct areas of software 'science' and now is the time to grow software world exponentially again, by means of innovation. What do I understand about his perspective on software is, mmm let me paint it for you.

Imagine a constructing scene, big machines working and some people there, tons of materials.. Let's think to match some with software world. Foundation frame, steel and water would be software engineering, along with operators that use big machines to carry stuff or pour cement. Cement in foundation would be team spirit, in other parts collaborated work. Big columns would be hackers. He always push you to imagine something and then match it with another thing. It's just like _painting_.

In one of his recent tweets he went;

"This will be increasingly common: big companies destroyed by failed software projects. https://goo.gl/KJLnGq". 

He also made references in his book about some software failures and how it will be like to cope up with big softwares in future. And guess what, he suggested software engineering practices for all. Since $/time in digital sector increased a lot from 2004 and all sectors relies on softwares, software engineering have been a must in all companies. Oh ok, not all companies have software engineers, but they must practice SWE to stand still in new world.

A good software engineer according to Graham;
"In software, paradoxical as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast. If you work slowly and meticulously, you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial, mistaken idea. Working slowly and meticulously is premature optimization. Better to get a prototype done fast, and see what new ideas it gives you."

There is too less time and too much work to do. That's the main problem. Software engineering is not just about planning but about to assure the continuity of that effective planning. Leafs of SWE are a lot but let me end this page with a nice quote and Dilbert.

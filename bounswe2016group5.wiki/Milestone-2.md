###Alignment with Customer

After the customer presentation, we got satisfactory feedback about topic. There is a request for embedded playing video links of materials. We will absolutely implement this feature. We got feedback about presentation for not to lose attention of audience and that we should use reliable means throughout project (imgur is blocked for example). Scenario was demonstrated to show, how our to-be-personas will use our system, yet inputs weren't prepared before so there was a loss of time during presentation. The demo should be complete and making sense for a user. In addition to that, the data used in demo should be formal, interesting and should not demoralize. Also as customer suggested, a subscriber of a topic should be able to follow his/her progress via quizes and related topics. And lastly, questions will be handled as customer requests. Questions will be highlighted as well as their answers.

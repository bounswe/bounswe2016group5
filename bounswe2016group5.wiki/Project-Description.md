# Cmpe352 Project
## An exploratory learning platform
### Overview
This project involves creating a learning space for learners and teachers. It focuses on the basic principles of material with a query based approach. It aims to be an engaging platform that motivates critical thinking and understanding the relations among concepts.
 
This platform will enable teachers to create material that exposes students to concepts and further exploration. In this context teacher is not necessarily a traditional teacher. Public education via any organization is possible. For example the climate change or child health care by government or non-governmental organizations are good examples. Likewise, a student club working on teaching programming to children would be a good example.
 
Teachers must be able to create content in terms of the basic principles and questions relating to the basic principles. They will be able to specify keywords that students can use to tag material that they are being exposed to. They also need to be able to relate questions to topics. Teachers must also be able to create a glossary for their topic. Glossaries must be searchable, so that users of the system can share them if they like to. A teacher, can introduce another definition that is suitable for their topic (i.e. architecture means different things in different contexts). They must also be able to add references related to the material they create. The same topic can be introduced by many different teachers – in their own way.
 
A typical question may be: “Why has the lufer population reduced in the Bosphorus?”
 
Students will be able to navigate and explore the material in terms of the basic principles and by answering questions. They will also be able to introduce content that is relevant to aspects of the topic. For example, photographs, articles, videos, etc. Students should be able to take self-tests. The system should present the user with a test based on their learning experience.
 
The progress of the student must be tracked in order to present them with appropriate content as well as to provide feedback to the teacher.
 
Feedback between learners and between learner and teacher is needed. Interaction may be regarding a question or following relationship.
 
Content and user recommendation must be supported.
 
Semantic tags will be used to facilitate semantic search and recommendations.
 
Web annotation model (https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) must to be used for annotation for tagging.
The application must have a web and mobile client (android).
Localization must be handled for alternative languages.

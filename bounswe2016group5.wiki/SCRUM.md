## Scrum

Scrum is one of agile software development methods for management of projects. For this method, we have 3 main features,

* **Transparency**: Daily notes must be taken and all these notes and other documentations can be seen everyone.

* **Inspection**: Product must be checked regularly.

* **Adaptation**: There are no exact rules from the beginning, plans can be modified.

Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation:

* Sprint Planning
* Daily Scrum
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

* **The Scrum Team**:
  * The Product Owner
  * The Development Team
  * The Scrum Master

#The Marshmallow Challenge


Marshmallow challenge is a design challenge that gives profound points about collaboration, task management and creativity. The task lies behind a pretty simple idea: teams of four people must build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, one yard of string and a marshmallow that has to be on top. It seems like a piece of cake, right? Actually, it isn't. Most teams that accept this challenge couldn’t even build a free-standing structure. So where does the tightness come from?


**1. Building Prototypes**


During the challenge, many teams spend their time for designing a strong tower. When the tower is done, they put the marshmallow on the top and there the disappointment comes: The structure is collapsed and they are out of time. What is the problem about spending majority of time with a sticky plan? A unique plan is the problem on its own. Successful teams prefer a prototype model. At every step of their work they put the marshmallow on the top and so that they don’t face with surprises. 


**2. The Effect of Facilitation** 


The experiences show that when the team has an executive admin, they show better results. Actually, it is all about facilitation, organization skills in the team and making the process faster. For example, when you give two people order a coke and a pizza, you have to assign these orders to each of them if you want get the orders as soon as possible. For marshmallow challenge, team members must recognize their capabilities and responsibilities in 18 minutes.

**3. Incentives and Success**


Teams are ready for the challenge but the director comes and says: we offer a 100.000 dollar prize for winning team. It must be a huge shock for everyone. Let’s make a divination, not a divination actually it is statistically, many teams will screw up because nobody expects a prize for it, nobody cares enough for it. Luckily they have a second chance now. This time, every team must practice a lot to create successful prototypes because everybody understands the value of the challenge. So incentives motivate teams in a good manner.


Tom Wujec says: “every project has its own marshmallow.”  If you want to understand the concept better, check the links out:

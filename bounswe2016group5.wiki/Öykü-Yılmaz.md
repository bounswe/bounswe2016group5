Hi, I'm Öykü Yılmaz. I'm an undergraduate student at CMPE. I'm really enthusiastic about Computer Graphics related stuff, but I haven't done any extensive study yet! Now, I'm taking a computer vision course and involving in a sign language recognition project. Fun fact about me: I like reading about western paintings and see them if I have the opportunity.

## Digest API
# Requirements
	Tomcat v9.0
	Maven
# Push Notes
	Do not push database.properties file with the database information in it.
# Notes
	If database.properties cannot be opened, it is most probably because of the tomcat working directory is not set correct. To set it in the eclipse, open run configurations, select tomcat server and open arguments tab. In arguments tap select working directory as workspace, digest.api and apply the changes.
# MySQL Editing
	For MySQL editing purposes, I suggest to use MySQL Workbench.
